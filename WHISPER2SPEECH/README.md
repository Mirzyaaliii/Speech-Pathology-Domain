# WHISPER2SPEECH Conversion

Some people, whose vocal folds, larynx, etc. have been affected by accident or disease, can converse by whispering. Loosing a typical way of producing speech will affect the patient's life tremendously since current speech processing algorithms are primarily developed based on an assumption that speech signal to be processed is in normal mode. Hence, there is a need of WHSP2SPCH conversion to ameliorate the life of impaired people in terms of speech communication. Moreover, the whispered speech communication has many interesting applications, such as private conversation in public using the cell phone, conversation in quiet environments, such as library, a hospital, a meeting room, etc.

<!--- GAN DNN model acheived mean MCD score of 8.14 with zero context.
    - For generator loss function is only MMSE which actually lead to better performance.
    - And discriminator loss is adversarial.-->

# Speech Pathology 

In recent era, Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs) like Google Assistant, Siri, Amazon Alexa, Cortana, etc. are used widely for many tasks of our day-to-day lives. However, there are some limimtations of these technologies. One of the limitations is that these IPAs are not able to understand impaired speech efficiently, and people with speech disability are not able to use them effectively. Hence, improvement in the intelligbility of a dysarthric speech is an essential task in order to make these IPAs more efficient for the impaired people. Main aim of this project is to solve this real life problem using Machine Learning (ML) techniques for speech pathology domain.

All big industries like gooogle, microsoft, amazon are also working on this problem, and try to make these IPAs more coherent with impaired speech.
